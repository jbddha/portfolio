Hello and welcome to my gitHub! 
I created this repository as a place to share my python journey. 
I'm working through Automate the Boring Stuff with Python right now, but I've moved to just trying to build programs that work. Hands-on learning is definitely superior. My next project will be an IOC scanner.
I'll keep this up to date with the 10 (or so) most recent programs I wrote.  
Thanks for visiting and happy scripting :)

Originally, I had my documentation for the Cloud Based Soc lab here, but I've cleaned it up and turned it into an instructional blog which you can find here:
