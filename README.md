Hello and welcome to my gitHub!
I created this repository as a place to share my python journey.
It's not an instructional blog as I'm obviously still a rookie.
I'll keep this up to date with the 10(or so) most recent programs I wrote.
I'll also do my best to label them with the relevant concept explored.
Thanks for visiting and happy coding :)
