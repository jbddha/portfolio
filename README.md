Hello and welcome to my gitHub! \n
I created this repository as a place to share my python journey. \n
I'm working through Automate the Boring Stuff with Python right now. \n
I'll keep this up to date with the 10 (or so) most recent programs I wrote. \n
I'll also do my best to label them with the relevant concept explored. \n
Thanks for visiting and happy scripting :) \n
